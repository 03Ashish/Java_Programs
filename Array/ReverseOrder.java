/*Exercise 5 â€” Reverse Order
Examine the following program: 
class Exercise5
{
 public static void main ( String[] args )
 {
 int[] val = {0, 1, 2, 3}; 
 int temp;
 System.out.println( "Original Array: " 
 + val[0] + " " + val[1] + " " + val[2] + " " + val[3] );
 // reverse the order of the numbers in the array
 System.out.println( "Reversed Array: " 
 + val[0] + " " + val[1] + " " + val[2] + " " + val[3] );
 }
}
Complete the program so that the numbers in the array appear in reversed order. You will need to 
use the variable temp to do this. 
Note: this is a harder exercise than you might guess. I sometimes put it on a midterm 
examination, and some students get the question wrong.

 public class ReverseOrder{
public static void main(String args[]){
int arr1[]={0,1,2,3};
int temp;
System.out.println("original value :" + arr1[0]+" "+arr1[1]+" "+arr1[2]+" "+arr1[3]);
System.out.println("Reversed order");
for( int i=arr1.length-1;i>=0 ;i--)
{
System.out.println(""+arr1[i]);

}
